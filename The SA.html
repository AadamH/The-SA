<p>My name is Aadam Hmaidi the creator of this website. I will teach you about an infamous paramilitary force called the SA (Sturmabteilung) or brownshirts and how they helped Adolf Hitler rise to power in Germany</p>
<h2> The rise of the Nazis</h2>
<p>In world war one the central powers Germany, Austria hungary and the Ottoman empire suffered a huge defeat from the triple entente Britain France and the US (Russia was in the war until the bolshevik revolution happened in 1917 which made them pull out of the war and negotiate peace with Germany) </p>
<p>Britain the US and france demanded Germany pay £6.6 billion for reperations and war damage and demanded they have 100,000 soldiers, no conscription, six battleships and crusiers, no air force and no anschluss (alliance) with their Austrian counterparts, give alsace lorraine to France and give their colonies in Africa to britain and France. This was called the treaty of Versailles. The people in Germany was lied to by the German government as they were telling their people Germany was winning but they werre losing. The people felt betrayed by the established Social Democrats government that negotiated with the allies. These reperations turned Germany from a powerful nation to a weak divided nation Military, econimocally, and politically. The people and political groups left wing and right wing stagged attempted plots to get rid of the Social Democrats an gain power for their own parties. All plots or putsch failed. But in Munich there was a right wing plot by the nazi party led by Adolf Hitler despite his plot failed and he was in prison it led to him getting recognition and fame across Germany.</p>
<p> In prison he wrote Mein Kampf my struggle where expressed anti semetic views on Jews and communists in Germany and was being defiant to the treaty of Versailles. Hitler was released from prison and he reformed the Nazi party turning them from a paramilitary force to a political system. He realized he had to change his tactics to gain power. He taught members of his party to be public speakers. One member of his inner circle Ernst Rohm a former officer in the German army and personal friend to Hitler. He created the SA which became who became thugs intimidating people to give the nazis votes which decreased the votes. They were also know as brownshirts for their uniform they marched in streets all over Germany which represented order and strength to the people which made people vote for the nazis. As the SA marching tactic was a clever plan because when Germany was a weak nation and people saw uniforms it made them believe if the nazis gain power they will make Germany strong. The SA was also used to fight the German communist party to make the communist look like the threat and the SA was keeping the german citizens safe. With Hitler`s reforms the nazi party got votes and more fame but did not gain power as of yet.</p> 

<h2>The great depression</h2>
<p> The great depression was an economic crisis that began im America when Wall street stock crashed which led to the businesses being shut down. The depression led to Europe which affected Germany the worst because a member of the Social Democrats called Gustav Stresemann became chancellor of Germany where he made changes to Germany such as making a trade deal with the USSR called treaty of Rapollo he made Germany a member of the league of nations he solved the hyper inflation with Germany by creating a new currency called the Ratenmark he negotiated with France when they invaded the Ruhr due to Germany not paying their reperations. He promised France they will pay reperations but only if the french withdrawed from the Ruhr which they did. </p>
<p>However to rebuild Germany he had to borrow money from the US this was called the Dawes plan and the Young plan. But when the depression reached Germany the US took their loans from Germany and took it back to the US. This made crime increase on a huge scale, increasing tensions of a civil war from political groups civil unrest. But the Great Depression allowed the nazis to shine german citizens turned to political parties like the nazis where the nazis created welfare for their citizens, provided soup kitchens and social services. The created propoganda was blaming the Social democrats, Jews and communists for the Depression which made people more right wing. The nazi tactis gained them more votes were Hitler became chancellor in 1933. </p>

<h2> Hitler as chancellor</h2>
<p> Hitler became chancellor when president paul von hindenburg appointed him because they shared the same views in 1933 where he introduced new laws such as investing in car industry which created new jobs and new cars like the Volkswagen and Mercedes. He made new  which programs included the construction of roads, bridges, and public buildings, as well as investments in the military. Hermann Goering created the Gestapo a secret police force operating in Prussia but expanded in Germany where they were in charge of eliminating resistance to the nazis. He also banned the communists in Germany when the Reichstag (german parliament ) was in flames. The authorities found a body a man called Marius van der lubbe where he was a member of the German communist party. Whether the nazis planted the body here is unknown but Hitler introduced a new law protection of the people and state where he had 2000 communists in Germany arrested. Hitler ordered the SA to break up communist meetings.  He banned all parties in Germany making the nazi party the major and powerful party. He banned all trading unions creating the German labour front as the only trade union in Germany. He created a censorship in Germany which Joseph Goebells a member of the inner circle to create their own propoganda in Germany and banned any propoganda that is not made by the nazis.
Hitler staged famous speeches at Nuremburg which he ordered an SA rally marching with uniforms to represent the Nazi strength. He was turning Germany in a dictatorship.</p>

<h2>The night of the Long Knives</h2>
<p>Hitler was now the most Powerful man in Germany and the Nazis was a one party system and they ruled every aspect of German society he decided to eliminate threats in his party. During his rise to power Hitler had argued with Ernst Rohm about a variety of topics and both men had different views but Hitler needed the SA which means he needed Rohm. But Rohm`s SA soldiers outnumbered the original German army by three million soldiers and wanted to control the German army. This worried Hitler because Rohm could easily stage a coup and overthrow Hitler. So Hitler turned to another paramilitary organisation the SS headed by Heinrich Himmler. The SS were like the SA but they were bodyguards for Hitler but under Heinrich Himmler they expanded. During Hitler`s rise to power Himmler was creating an intelligence agency called the SD but needed a spymaster. One follower of the nazi party Lina Heydrich introduced the Nazi party to her husband Reinhard Heydrich a disgraced naval officer who was desperate. Lina set up an interview with Himmler and Heydrich where Heydrich was recruited by Himmler to be in charge of the SD. Heydrich had no experience in espionage but he was an effecive spymaster for Himmler he became experienced in using the SD to intimidate and terrorise enemies of the nazi party. </p>
<p>Hitler`s inner circle members especially Himmler and Heydrich wanted to get rid of the SA like Hitler did but they needed serious evidence. Heydrich ordered his SA to create fake evidence where the Rohm was paid by France to stag a coup in Germany. So Hitler gave the order to purge the SA. But he planned out the Purge in stages. He stopped military exercises and dismissed them from active services and placed them in smaller groups so they are easier to locate. Heydrich masterminded the Purge which resulted in the death of 150 to 250 SA leaders and members in three days. Rohm was arrested but was offered to commit suicide but refused so two SS officers shot him three times. The SS may have also executed Rohm because he was a Homosexual. The SS were antisemetic anti communist anti anyone who is not German and homophobic as they were a radical racially pure organisation they may have saw Rohm as a subhuman. The SA still existed but their manpower was reduced significantly and cast aside  now considered useless by Hitler. After WW2 the group ws disbanded by the allies where the allies branded them a terrorist and criminal organisation.</p> <p> The Purge also allowed the SS to purge political enemies outside of the party not just the SA. Paul Von hindenburg of the Social Democrats died during the event but is unclear if he was assassinated.</p>
<p> The night of the long Knives was the largest political purge in history which shocked the world. It led to Hitler becoming supreme leader or Fuhrer. It led to the SS rising to power being in control of the security of the Reich and the most powerful paramilitary force in Germany. It also led to Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich controlling every police force in Germany.</p>

<h2> The SA accomplishements</h2>
<p> The SA played a huge role in making Hitler rise to power. They were crucial for the nazis to combat the German communists and getting votes for the nazis as their uniforms represented strength and order. However they were extremely successful in creating terror and intimidating political enemies and forcing people voting for the nazis. But they were the reason as well the the nazis lost some votes for their campaign on violence. The SA was also used to spread Nazi propaganda and help promote the party's message to the public. They distributed pamphlets, held rallies, and used other tactics to promote Nazi ideology.  The SA helped to recruit new members for the Nazi Party, especially among working-class Germans who were attracted to the SA's promises of economic and social reform.  The SA provided military training to its members, which helped to prepare them for the street battles and other violent conflicts that were a regular feature of German politics in the 1920s and early 1930s. The SA's leader, Ernst Röhm, was a close ally of Hitler and played a key role in the early years of the Nazi Party. He helped to build support for the party among working-class Germans and was seen as a potential rival to Hitler within the party. As people in Germany could have been more loyal to Rohm instead of Hitler.</p>
